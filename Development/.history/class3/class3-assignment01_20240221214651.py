#     - Comment your code 
#         +5
#     - Assign meaningful variable names 
#         +5
#     - Output a print statement, "The perimeter of your triangle is..." 
#         +5
#     - The test case for your program is side # 1 is 5, the base is 6, side # 2 is 10 
#         +5
#     - Output a print statement, "Is side 1 greater than side 2?" 
#         +5
#     - Output a print statement, "Is the base equal to side 1?"

# '''
# Define the sides of my triangle
side1 = 5
side2 = 10
base = 6

# Calculate the perimeter of the triangle
perimeter = side1 + side2 + base

# Print the perimeter of the triangle
print("The perimeter of your triangle is ...:", perimeter)

# Check if side 1 is greater than side 2
print("Is side 1 greater than side 2?", side1 > side2)

# Check if the base is equal to side 1
print("Is the base equal to side 1?", base == side1)
