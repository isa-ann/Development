Exercise

Write some code that takes in numbers from a user one at a time. This should keep going until the user enters 0. Then print the sum of all the numbers.
If the user inputs something that isn't a number, an error message should appear and the program should stop. (Hint: use break)

Example (no error):
5
12
0
Sum: 17

Example (error):
5
7
c
Error: Not a number
